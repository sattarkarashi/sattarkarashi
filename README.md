### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I'm a programmer with a passion for problem-solving and algorithmic development. I primarily work with Python and Rust, leveraging their strengths for various projects.  In addition to my core coding skills, I've spent the past two years exploring the exciting world of blockchain and algorithmic trading using Python and MQL5.

I'm always eager to learn and tackle new challenges, and I'm excited to connect with others who share similar interests.
