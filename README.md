### ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! 

- ðŸŒ± I'm a Python developer with a wicked sense of curiosity and a passion for making cool things.

- ðŸ”­ As a lover of both coding and the Forex market, I've found my sweet spot in implementing algorithmic trading strategies. My solutions are designed to be adaptable to various markets, but I have a particular fondness for Forex pairs. And to take things to the next level, I offer APIs that provide backtesting, forward testing, and optimization automation to make sure everything is running like a well-oiled machine. So, let's work together to crack the code and make some profitable trades!

- ðŸ‘¯ When I'm not busy saving the world from imminent doom, I like to spend my free time collaborating on open source projects. Just doing my part to make the world a better place, one code contribution at a time!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Teal Â· Solidity Â· JavaScript Â· React.js Â· Python (Programming Language) Â· Django
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like farming and hiking.
